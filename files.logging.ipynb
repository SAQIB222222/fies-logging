    "The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened using the open() function in Python. When you open a file, the operating system reserves some resources to allow the program to access the file. These resources include the file descriptor and the file buffer. If you do not close the file properly, these resources will remain locked, which can cause problems if the program needs to access the file again or if other programs need to access the file.\n",

    "It ensures that any changes made to the file are saved. When you write to a file, the data is stored in a buffer until the buffer is full or until you close the file. If you do not close the file, the data may not be written to the file properly, and you may lose some or all of the data you wrote to the file.\n",
    "It prevents file corruption or data loss. If you open a file for writing and then open it again without closing the first instance of the file, you may overwrite the original file, which can result in data loss or file corruption.\n",
